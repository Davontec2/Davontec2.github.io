            Sitting in a dark stage waiting for my queue to start the play. I waitting for my queue and my stomach is filled with butterflies and me being the stage manager had me scared . Having rehearsal like once a week had me on edge throughout the play. But at the end the play was a success.
            At a young age I realized my brothers always wanted to be involved in theater. They always watched High School Musicals and  Les Miserables. My older brother wants to be an actor, so watching this play was the world for him. And one day I decided to watch it with him. This play opened a doorway that inspired me to try acting. Once On This Island was the first play my school put on. And being a part of this play I was overjoyed, learned about the crew behind the scenes  from my peers. So when I got into high school and saw that they had a tech theater crew, I was excited.
            For the last three years, I’ve been in tech crew, helping in production, putting on plays in different roles, leading everyone, and  things that have to do on stage like make sure that the props were in the correct place and the communication radios were on. In 11th grade, I was signed as the stage manager or leader for the Black students union (BSU) play, the first time doing that position. I learned that it takes a lot of organizing and teamwork to put a production on. Throughout the production I worked with my team all day.I remember one of the scenes was too dark. The red color made everyone on stage unseeable so I spent some time with the light board team to fix it. But we decided to Put a dark green for the beginning parts and have the spotlight team  hit the characters in the story, but for the end part we use a pink color for it because it looked cool. I spent so many days just making the run script so my team could see how the production was going to run. After getting it on paper I had to spend all night annotating the main script so I could give out cues. Performing at night when everything comes together is the best feeling ever. Nothing is as rewarding to me as having seen my hard work pay off through others enjoyment of art I helped create. From the tech crew I decided to try out my
            improv team. The team was friendly and I know all of them from tech crew or class. One time in improv I was a therapist  for muppets. And  Oscar the grouch came to me . Talking about how he was born in the trash can he lives in , and how hard it is being green and living in a trash can. I got more comfortable with my personality, always making jokes , and trying to have a good vibe. Improv and tech crew help me be myself and give me a way to express that to others.    Theater and improv made me more confidence and communicating better.
 It gave me a sense of responsibility , and the drive to work as hard as I can. With theis skills / lesson  it prepared me for the future and the challenges I’ll face. Theater and improv helped me learn that life is a crazy highway that has twists and turns and I can’t just stop playing my role. I feel that my future is decided for me to be the same as I was in high school.
